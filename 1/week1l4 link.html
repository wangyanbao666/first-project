If you see something that says “#WordoftheDay,” the tweet or post has something to do with Word of the Day. And, once you click on that marked topic, you’ll likely see all public posts about it. It’s a great tool for finding people who are talking about a particular subject (and for categorizing pictures of your fantastic pet). But, what do we call the # symbol? And, where did it come from? Some of its names are common . . . some not so much.</p>
